    A quality curriculum takes a long time to build and is continuously evolving as more research is performed and more data is collected. It should also be created by many members of the community, and should include the parents, local employers, teachers, and elected education officials, such as the Board of Education. The curriculum should also reflect the needs of society; for example, as society has placed a greater demand for technology in the digital age, curricula should put a greater focus on mathematics and computer science. With everyone always having access to information right at their fingertips, information recall is no longer important; instead, application of information needs to be the main focus of schools. Most importantly, a curriculum needs to create a logical sequence for age appropriate subject matter that allows all students to prosper regardless of their preferred learning style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learning is the process in which experiences and information come together to create knowledge or skills. In a classroom, the information is the material that is being taught and experiences are each problem solved added together. The material and practice combine to form the knowledge and skills that students strive for. Immediately, some may subconsciously think about schools, but learning does not only occur in the classroom as one can learn a sport, learn how to play an instrument, learn how to draw, learn how to change a tire, and there are many more things to learn. In a sport, practice makes perfect, but you still need to know the rules in order to master the game—the same thing applies to the classroom. In the classroom, the material is the rules or information and the exercises are the practice or experience.
  </p>
  <p>
   The purpose of schools is to educate children to the point where they can be effective members of society. Different subject areas have different purposes to achieve this final goal. Social Studies and English Language Arts try to promote students to be positive moral members of society. Mathematics and Science influence students to be logical thinkers. Foreign Language helps students be able to communicate across language barriers. Electives such as business classes, classes in the arts, computer science classes, or even vocational schools attempt to give students a taste of a specific field to see if that is where the student would like to contribute to society. I found the motivation to become a teacher in one of these elective-style classes, specifically my high school computer science classes.

    While the purpose of the school system is to prepare students to be productive members of society, the main purpose of teaching is to inform the students on the subject matter according to the curriculum. In order to achieve that goal, each lesson has to be catered to the students’ individual needs. Some students’ needs may include spending more time on a specific topic and maybe modifying a different one. Different groups of students will learn at different paces, so each class will not necessarily be at the exact same point at the same time. Some students might struggle with abstract concepts and will need real life examples or demonstrations with physical objects. This is why differentiation is so important in the classroom. When I was going from middle school to high school, I was entering a regional high school district. Each town had its own district and curriculum for K-8. Six different high schools made up an entirely separate 9-12 district with a standard curriculum. While there are benefits, specifically the magnet programs that the district is able to offer, this specifically caused issues in my freshman year biology class. Since my K-8 district had a different biology curriculum, I had a different set of knowledge than any of the other students in my class. Instead of differentiating, the teacher would constantly run out of material for me and I was left to do work from my other classes over half of the time I was in that classroom. In my classroom, material will be at each student's own ability levels, regardless of whether that is above or below the average in the room.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a teacher, I will try to get to know my students and have them get to know each other and myself, as well as set clear classroom rules and expectations during the first week. This would help me learn the students’ needs in the first place. During practice exercises, students will be in heterogeneous groups that have students of mixed understanding levels because explaining creates a larger understanding. The students who already have a strong grasp of the material would get an even stronger grasp because they were explaining the material to the other students. The students who previously did not have a strong grasp would get the material presented in a new way by their peers. Students will be encouraged to ask any questions that relate to the material and will know that the only silly questions are those that should have been asked but were not. I will also enforce the idea that it does not matter what level you are at within the class, only that you are personally improving at an acceptable rate.

  </p>
  <p>
    If a student does not feel comfortable in a classroom, they will not participate and they will not focus as much on the teacher and will therefore fall behind in their learning. Specifically in mathematics, many studies have researched this: two identical classes—one with a positive learning environment and the other with a negative learning environment—will each move onto a new topic when all of the students in that class reach an equal, predetermined benchmark of understanding. In their results, the students in the positive environment were able to learn an additional month of topics compared to the students in the negative environment.
