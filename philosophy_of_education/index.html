    The purpose of schools is to educate children to the point where they can be effective members of society. Different subject areas have different purposes to achieve this final goal. Social studies and english language arts try to promote students to be positive moral members of society. Mathematics and sciences influence students to be logical thinkers. Foreign language helps students be able to communicate across language barriers. Electives such as business classes, classes in the arts, computer science classes, or even vocational schools attempt to give students a taste of a specific field to see if that is where the student would like to contribute to society. I found the motivation to become a teacher in one of these elective style classes, specifically my high school computer science classes.

    Learning is the process in which experiences and information came together to create knowledge or skills. In a classroom, the information is the material and experiences are like each problem solved that come together to form the knowledge and skills that students strive for. Some might think subconsciously immediately about schools, but learning does not only occur in the classroom as one can learn a sport, learn how to play an instrument, learn how to draw, learn how to change a tire, and there are many more things to learn. In a sport practice makes perfect, but you still need to know the rules in order to master the game, the same thing applies to the classroom. In the classroom, the material is the rules or information and the exercises are the practice or experience.

    A quality curriculum takes a long time to build and is continuously evolving as more research is performed and more data is collected. It should also be created by a large group of members of the community, which includes the parents, employers, teachers, and elected education officials, such as the board of education. The curriculum should also reflect the needs of society, for example as society has placed a greater demand for technology during the digital age, curriculums should put a greater focus on mathematics and computer science. Most importantly, a curriculum needs to create a logical sequence for age appropriate subject matter that allows all students to prosper regardless of their preferred learning style.

    The whole point of teaching is to inform the students, and in order to do that the lesson has to be catered to the students needs. These needs could be to spend more time on a specific topic and maybe shorten a different one. Different groups of students will learn at different paces, so each class will not necessarily be at the exact same point at the same time. Some students might struggle with abstract concepts and will need real life examples or demonstrations with physical objects. When I was going from middle school to high school, I was entering a regional high school district so each town had its own district and curriculum for K-8 and then it was one combined district and curriculum for high school. This specifically caused issues in my freshman year biology class, due to the fact that I had a whole year of biology in 7th grade and the last time anyone else had seen biology in my class was back in elementary school, so the teacher would constantly run out of material for me and I was left to do work from my other classes over half of the time I was in that classroom.

    I would try to get to know my students and have them get to know each other and me, as well as setting clear expectations, during the first week. This would help me learn the studentsâ€™ needs in the first place. During exercises students will be in groups that have students of mixed understanding levels because explaining creates a larger understanding so the students that have a greater grasp of the material would get a greater grasp and help the students that might not have a great understanding. Students will be encouraged to ask any questions that relate to the material and will know that the only silly questions are those that should have been asked but were not. I will also enforce the idea that it does not matter what level you are at within the class only that you are personally improving at an acceptable rate.

    If a student does not feel comfortable in a classroom, they will not participate and they will not focus as much on the teacher and will therefore fall behind in their learning. Specifically in mathematics many studies have shown that if there are two as identical as possible classes and one has a positive learning environment and the other has a negative environment, and they both will move onto a new topic when students have the same level of understanding, the students in the positive environment will get an additional month of topics covered compared to the students in the negative environment.
