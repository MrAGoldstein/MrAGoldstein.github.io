        During the fall of my sophomore year of college at Rider University(the fall of 2020), I participated in a
        field experience with Fisher Middle School. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the field experience took place
        virtually, with the teacher and half of the students in the classroom and the other half of the students in a
        Google Meet with me and another Rider University student. During the field experience, I was placed in an
        honors seventh grade math class, which was an algebra class. Some of the tasks that were assigned to me were if
        a student was struggling with a problem during an activity demonstrate how to solve the problem, provide
        feedback to students as they were working on an assignment, and ask students to share their answers to the
        Do-Now and homework.

        During the spring of my junior year at Rider University, I had the opportunity to experience Hopewell Valley
        Central High School. Hopewell Valley was my first experience teaching in person, as Fisher Middle was remote.
        During this semester, I had my first opportunities to create my own lessons and execute them. I also circulated
        the room and helped students who were having trouble. We taught Honors Algebra 2, as well as inclusion and
        regular algebra 1.

          For my senior year, I spent the whole year working with Lawrence Township Public Schools. In the fall, I was
          in Lawrence Middle School, working in Seminar Math 7. In this course students learned about topics that did
          not fit very well into the regular 7th grade math curriculum. The big idea that was being focused on during
          my time there was probability. Another challenge that I did not face previously was the number of students
          that were english language learners. There was no support and some of these students spoke no English at all.
          During the course of the Semester, there were several times that I wrote lesson plans and taught lessons.

          For my final semester and my Student Teaching placement, I went across the parking lot staying in the same
          district, but going to Lawrence High School. During this full-time student teaching placement, I got to
          experience everyday in the school rather than just one time per week. After getting slowly eased in, I took
          over more and more classes. I taught Honors Geometry and Algebra 2 as well as Inclusion Geometry. My daily
          tasks included but were not limited to planning lessons to teach in conjunction with my cooperating teacher,
          grading students work, teaching lessons, circulating the room answering students' questions, and many more.
