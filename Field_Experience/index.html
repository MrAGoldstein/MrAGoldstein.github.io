        During the fall of my sophomore year of college at Rider University(the fall of 2020), I participated in a field experience with Fisher Middle School. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the field experience took place virtually, with the teacher and half of the students in the classroom and the other half of the students in a Google Meet with me and another Rider University student. During the field experience, I was placed in an honors seventh grade math class, which was an algebra class. Some of the tasks that were assigned to me were if a student was struggling with a problem during an activity demonstrate how to solve the problem, provide feedback to students as they were working on an assignment, and ask students to share their answers to the Do-Now and homework.
